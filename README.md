# EyeDiseaseProject
We are classifying eye images using a Convolutional Neural Network to determine if the eye has one of three diseases (Cataracts, Glaucoma, or Diabetic Retinopathy) or no disease.

## Data Background
Glaucoma: 
Eye pressure due to the inability to drain fluid damages the optic nerve.

Cataracts:
Aging or injury damages eye tissue, leading to less clear/cloudy vision.

Diabetic Retinopathy:
Blood vessels leak fluid and bleed, which leads to weakened and damaged blood vessels in the eyes from diabetes.

## Evaluation
Testing score of ~0.81.
Model struggles the most with identifying Glaucoma.
